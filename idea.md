# Ideas
* enable video creation for manually created albums. 
* implement fallback logic for SimplePlacesResolver that does not need PostGIS extension

# Improvements - image selection for video
* dont pick faces last. this should be done earlier in the process
* select images by requested orientation (landscape/portrait)


# refactoring
* replace if..else constructs. that is bad code style
